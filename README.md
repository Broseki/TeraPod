## What is TeraPod?
TeraPod is an opensource system for managing IoT devices via a common interface, namely to allow for physical controls (buttons, switches, etc.) to be configured to connect to and control various smart devices. The end goal is to allow for non-standard controls for normally voice/app controlled devices.
