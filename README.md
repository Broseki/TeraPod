# TeraPod
TeraPod is an opensource system for managing small, indoor greenhouses (i.e. "TeraPods"). This system is intended to control heat, humidity, and lighting; and will be able to follow schedules which can be shared with other users. This is currently early in the development stage, and not ready at all for real use.
