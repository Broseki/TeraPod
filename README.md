## What is TeraPod?
TeraPod is an opensource system for managing IoT devices via a common interface, namely to allow for physical controls (buttons, switches, etc.) to be configured to connect to and control various smart devices. The end goal is to allow for non-standard controls for normally voice/app controlled devices.

## Why?
A major problem with smart devices is the fact that they currently assume a person can use voice as their main method of controlling the devices. This assumption does not work if the user is, for example, deaf. TeraPod is an effort to allow users to connect non-standard control devices to their smarthome so they don't miss out on the benefits IoT devices can provide.

## Disclaimer
This project makes no claim as to its the safety, stability, or efficacy. This is highly experimental and should
not be used to control things that are critical, or could cause fires or other damage. Because some of this code lights, and other potentially dangerous electrical devices you are running this at your own risk, there is no promise that your property will not burn down or otherwise become damaged because of errors in the design of TeraPod. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
